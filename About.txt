About: This program will create datasets for piecewise functions on the interval [0,1). The generated information will be stored in a given filepath in 3 documents:
1.) A .csv file containing the dataset as x,y pairs
2.) A .txt file containing a description of the dataset
3.) A .png file containing an image of the plotted dataset

Customization:
1.) To save data in a file path other than the desktop, line 109 will need to be modified.
2.) To modify the number of pieces desired, line 113 will need to be modified.
3.) To modify the number of datapoints desired, line 114 will need to be modified.
4.) The program currently randomly selects the possible degrees of the polynomials as well as the possible coefficients.
	a.) To modify the degrees, line 34 will need to be modified.
	b.) To modify the coefficients, lines 38, 42, and 45 will need to be modified.
5.) The program currently generates datapoints on the interval [0,1). To adjust, line 49 will need to be modified.
